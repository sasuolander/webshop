The system provides a different set of functionality for each user role. User roles in the system: 

Non-logged-in User

Customer

Administrator


Table 1 below lists the functionality available for the different user roles. By default, when a user comes to the web store pages, they are a Non-logged-in User. 

To use the functionality available for the roles of Customer or Admin, the prerequisite is that a user logs in and has that role.

Required data models include data models for the Users, Products, and Orders. Other data models can complement these, and groups can add new ones as needed.

The implementation must take into account Web applicationâ€™s security, and implement sufficient safeguards against security threats.

The default authentication mechanism is Basic authentication.
